和三个头部新锐品牌聊完，我们总结了腾讯全域经营的落地指南,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxMDgyNzQzMw==&mid=2247583512&idx=1&sn=c28e2f29e3c58b3627fe17443324cad3,"@葆 Frank Lin [ChatGPT]以下是关于中国新锐品牌全域经营的 Vega 总结要点：

1. 以人群为先的品牌更适合采用全域运营方式。
2. 全域经营的关键在于当用户产生第一次消费后，如何通过精细化运营挖掘更大的用户生命周期价值。
3. 新锐品牌如何从网红到长红？重点在于产品的创新及整合营销，通过私域进行营销，提升高客单。
4. 流量成本相对较高时，品牌需要聚焦于产品的差异性、全域的运营和出海。
5. 美瞳赛道属于第三类医疗器械，2020 年之前不能做新媒体投放，品牌关键在于品牌力的建设和高客单。"

深度 | 一年一度“投资指南”，解读巴菲特2023致股东信,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI5ODcyNzgxOQ==&mid=2247545860&idx=1&sn=cd1d1f93fe3dd8cf3e9f3a175212718d,"Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, recently released his annual letter to shareholders. Here are seven key points from the letter:

1. Capitalism has a two-sided nature. On one hand, it creates more and more failures, but on the other hand, it brings a lot of improved products and services. Buffett calls this phenomenon ""creative destruction.""
2. The concept of an ""efficient market"" for stocks only exists in textbooks. Stocks can sometimes trade at stupid prices, either high or low.
3. Shareholders should focus on stock dividends and the company's long-term profitability. Buffett advises investors to pay attention to profits but not to take quarterly data too seriously, as they are too volatile. He also emphasized that Berkshire's insurance ""float"" had grown from $14.7 billion to $16.4 billion after the acquisition of Alleghany Corporation in 2022, an increase of 8000 times since 1976.
4. The secret to the company's success is that it has caught the ""American Tailwind."" According to Buffett, the company's success is due to the power of savings, compounding, avoiding significant errors, and most importantly, catching the ""American Tailwind."" Without Berkshire Hathaway, the United States would still be doing fine, but not as well as with the company's contribution.
5. The company will always hold a large amount of cash and US bonds, as well as various other more extensive businesses. Buffett said that the company will always maintain healthy cash flow, avoiding any rash behavior that could cause a cash flow shortage, even during financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses.
6. The enormous US budget deficit is deeply rooted and may have serious consequences.
7. The annual shareholder meeting will be held on May 5th-6th in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, are pleased to see that Berkshire Hathaway's massive capital flows to public demand, and their shareholders are rarely concerned about the company's assets and empire-building.

Finally, Buffett warns that operating profits in financial statements are closely monitored, but these numbers can be easily manipulated by managers if they want to. Typically, CEOs, directors, and their advisors believe that this kind of manipulation is the norm. Journalists and analysts also treat this behavior as commonplace, but investors should be cautious."

It talks about the success of Luckin Coffee in offering coffee at lower prices than Starbucks and the emergence of new players in the industry who are also offering low-priced coffee to compete with Luckin. The article categorizes these new players into three types: national brands, regional brands, and local Shanghai brands. Among these, Luckin and Kudi Coffee are identified as the most aggressive in terms of pricing, with some of their offerings priced as low as 5 yuan per cup. The article also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in vacant commercial spaces, which has attracted many new players to enter the coffee industry and engage in a price war to gain market share."

2023，咖啡卷到5元了,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NzAwMzU0MA==&mid=2247575660&idx=1&sn=858d12a84639ea3a25b97288980e9907,"@葆 Frank Lin 1. Luckin Coffee was once the leading coffee chain in China but has faced significant setbacks due to its financial fraud scandal. 

2. There are now several new coffee chains vying for market share in China, including both regional and national brands. 

3. Two of the most prominent chains are Luckin Coffee's spinoff, Luckin Kaffee, and a new brand called Kuai Kuai Coffee. These brands have lower prices than their competitors, and their expansion has been very fast. 

4. Kuai Kuai Coffee is marketed as a more upscale version of Luckin Coffee, with similar products but slightly higher prices. 

5. There are also several low-price coffee brands that have emerged in recent years, with a focus on new first-tier and second-tier cities. These include brands like Ao Tiger Coffee, Jueke Coffee, and Dagongren Coffee. 

6. These brands often have only a few dozen or a few hundred locations, but they have similar stories to Luckin Coffee, focusing on low prices and following a similar business model. 

7. These low-price brands are typically marketed towards younger consumers, who are more price-sensitive and not as loyal to established brands. 

8. The low-price coffee trend in China is likely to continue, as more companies try to tap into the vast potential market of young Chinese consumers who are looking for affordable and high-quality coffee."
ChatGPT在县城，时髦年轻人已经用它吊打同事了,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3OTEwMDQwNw==&mid=2649941800&idx=2&sn=cbb629fbaac72e37c35b6689da2679b2,"@葆 Frank Lin 这 is a news article in Chinese, which roughly translates to:

""Core Tip: ChatGPT has been popular in China for over a month now. This intelligent chatbot that makes AI giants fight has become a tool for young people on the cutting edge of information in county towns. Liu Xiaoyun, who works at a large manufacturing plant in her hometown in Shanxi Province, personally experienced the powerful assistance ChatGPT provided to her and her colleagues in the county workplace. How did ChatGPT save them from the ""sea of misery"" of writing materials? What kind of Matthew effect do young people in small towns have in terms of information cognition? Liu Xiaoyun described the county workplace related to ChatGPT to the ""Post Wave Research Institute"".

The article describes how ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, has become popular among young people in county towns in China. Liu Xiaoyun, who works at a large manufacturing plant in Shanxi Province, explains how she and her friends have been using ChatGPT to help them with their work. For example, when she was tasked with writing several speeches for a company event, she used ChatGPT to help her organize her thoughts and write the speeches. ChatGPT was also used by her friend who works at a bank to help him write a report.

The article explores the benefits of using ChatGPT for people who are not proficient in writing, as well as its impact on information cognition in small towns. It suggests that young people in county towns are able to use ChatGPT to access information and knowledge that they might not have had access to before, which gives them an advantage in the workplace."

首批 ChatGPT 应用将打响 To B 的编程应用争夺战！,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MjAwODM4MA==&mid=2650957258&idx=1&sn=1af594695a8053b82a317222686763bc,"@葆 Frank Lin Summary of Vega's Key Points:

1. Programmers will not be replaced, but their technology stack will change.
2. ChatGPT will enable the application of artificial intelligence technology and usher in a new era of applications.
3. The first batch of AI applications will not be in the consumer space but in the enterprise space, leading to a big explosion in To B.
4. Open-source AI operating systems will emerge in the future, and China will have its own AI OS.

Additional points from Jiang Tao's speech:

5. Jiang Tao has been in the industry for many years and started as a programmer who built CSDN, a platform for programmers, and founded training companies and publishing houses.
6. Jiang Tao believes that the next decade will be a better one for the industry, especially for new programmers.
7. Open-source concepts originated from the programmer community.
8. CSDN collected keywords related to AI, and while they are closely related to open-source frameworks and projects, their overall relevance to AI is still low.
9. China's contribution to open source projects is not yet high, with Chinese developers making up only 9.5% of the 20,000 contributors to over 5,000 global projects.
10. Programming languages will continue to evolve, but the new era of programmers will need to learn how to articulate problems and use intelligent operating systems' capabilities through dialogue."
