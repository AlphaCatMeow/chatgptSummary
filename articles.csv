美股调整，A股能否“独善其身”？（国金宏观·赵伟团队）,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwNzQ3MzY4Nw==&mid=2247530407&idx=1&sn=4bf2815b728598fa8923cd3728689709,@葆 Frank Lin 这篇文章讨论了美股调整对A股市场的影响，并提供了历史数据和分析，以便参考。文章指出，过去的经验表明，当美国经济步入衰退初期时，美股易因“杀盈利”而调整，国内市场容易跟随下跌。然而，文章还探讨了A股市场能否独立于美股下跌的情况，并列举了几个可能的因素，例如中国对美出口的下滑、市场情绪冲击和外资流入。最后，文章提供了风险提示，包括美联储货币政策收紧超预期、海外经济衰退超预期和国内经济复苏不及预期等。需要注意的是，文章最后也提醒，使用国金证券研究报告进行投资需谨慎，应该经过专业人士解读。

亚洲加息周期渐近尾声,http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg4NDI1NjEwNA==&amp;mid=2247492363&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=a27d64ca0daec120004bbba2a45e265f&amp;chksm=cfb85f0cf8cfd61a48f6eb50ee05d94210a760ab58b189d596c68184d2fff5b187e1b1d47e3c&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=0301kopkRl4dHxXwz13PVixL&amp;sharer_sharetime=1677664431654&amp;sharer_shareid=d879382540b2a3aee7d2b68faaa916a7#rd,摩根士丹利亚洲首席经济学家陈艾亚表示，尽管市场反映出对美联储利率峰值的更高预期，亚洲的货币紧缩周期即将结束，因为亚洲的通胀主要由成本推动，且亚洲各经济体的国内通胀状况仍在决定央行政策力度方面发挥着重要作用。90%的亚洲经济体的通胀有望回落到各自央行的舒适区间。陈艾亚认为大多数央行将在2023年第一季度末暂停紧缩周期，印度央行和澳大利亚央行的紧缩周期将分别于4月和5月结束，而日本央行将在今年调整或退出收益率曲线控制政策，并在2024年加息一次。然而，如果出现更持久的通胀压力，观点可能会面临风险。对于亚洲各经济体央行而言，国内的经济增长和通胀形势在本轮周期中比外部压力更为重要。近几个月来，亚洲的通胀数据持续低于市场预期，9个经济体的整体通胀已见顶，这一系列数据再次印证了亚洲紧缩周期即将结束。
对话「NOWWA咖啡」郭星君：去年营收同比翻三倍，「平价与口感」成咖啡市场核心变量,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1Njk1MDgyMQ==&mid=2247502269&idx=1&sn=2629353b46076a31a6095fa455e6d30d,"@葆 Frank Lin NOWWA is a Chinese brand that specializes in affordable yet high-quality coffee. During the 2023 Spring Festival, NOWWA opened 110 new stores across China, bringing its total number of stores to over 1800 in more than 100 cities. The brand has become one of the fastest-growing affordable boutique coffee brands in China. Its revenue during the Spring Festival period increased by 223% year-on-year, with some stores in fourth- and fifth-tier cities doubling or even tripling their revenue, while second- and third-tier cities saw increases of more than 50%.

NOWWA's founder, Guo Xingjun, said that the brand's focus is on the ""sinking market"" and providing high-quality coffee to small-town youth who have a desire for a better life. He believes that there is still ample space for affordable coffee brands in the sinking market, and that the profit margins in these areas are higher than those in first- and second-tier cities.

NOWWA's revenue nearly tripled in 2022 compared to the previous year, with the brand signing nearly 1000 new franchise agreements. Guo said that the brand will continue to sign new agreements for nearly 1000 new stores in 2023, with a focus on franchise and company-owned stores.

Guo believes that the entrance of cross-industry enterprises into the coffee market is a good thing, as it helps to cultivate consumer habits and expand the market. He does not see them as competitors, but rather as potential partners. NOWWA plans to replace its 1.0 version stores, which were focused on takeaway, and its 2.0 version stores, which were independent stalls, with its new 3.0 version stores, which will consist of franchise and company-owned stores.

NOWWA's expansion is fueled by its affordable prices and high-quality coffee, which has attracted a loyal customer base. The brand's success in the sinking market highlights the potential for affordable boutique coffee brands in China's smaller cities and towns."
爆火的AI绘画，养活了一大批“周边生意”,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTAzMjc4MA==&mid=2650473629&idx=2&sn=463d863e14f0609c67a87d6e74f3e25b,"@葆 Frank Lin AI painting has become popular again recently due to its bizarre style, attracting a large number of users to experience it. Although the experience is not always satisfactory, it has still created a thriving ""ancillary business"", with some listed companies also investing in it. This article discusses the business behind AI painting.

The article notes that AI painting has created a new ecosystem that is gradually forming in areas that few people have seen, such as wallpaper creation, prompt word writing, and art collection creation.

One of the keys to generating good AI paintings is the ability to write good prompt words. Because the images generated by AI painting tools are uncertain, many people often need to try multiple inputs and different texts to get the image they are satisfied with. This leads to wasted GPU computing power and user money. Therefore, some companies with a keen sense of smell have begun to sell ""prompt words.""

PromptBase, which was established in June this year, is a company that specializes in selling ""prompt words"" for AI painting tools. Its prompt words initially only worked with DALL-E 2, GPT-3, and other models, but later also supported Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Users can buy a prompt word for $1.99 and copy it to the corresponding platform to generate satisfactory works. PromptBase charges a 20% service fee in each transaction, which is processed through Stripe.

At present, PromptBase has launched many prompt words on its platform, covering pixel art, graphic design, 3D models, logos, and wallpapers.

The article also mentions other similar websites, such as NeutronField, which was set up by senior product designer Miroslav Kostić and sells prompt words for DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, Disco Diffusion, Craiyon (DALL-E Mini), etc. Its prompt words' prices range from $1 to $10, covering themes and styles from animals, robots to photography, and 3D rendering.

Although there are no specialized platforms selling AI painting prompt words in China yet, some scattered merchants have begun to sell their own prompt word documents and tools that extract prompt words from images. If you search for ""AI painting"" on Taobao, you can find many products with titles such as ""AI intelligent painting installation"" and ""AI painting keyword encyclopedia,"" which often sell installation packages and prompt words for painting tools such as Discord Diffusion and Midjourney, while some shop owners have also developed their own prompt word extraction programs and sell them on Taobao."
